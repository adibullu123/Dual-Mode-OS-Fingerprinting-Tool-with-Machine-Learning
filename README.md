# Dual-Mode-OS-Fingerprinting-Tool-with-Machine-Learning

This research implements an advanced OS fingerprinting tool employing a hybrid approach, combining passive fingerprinting via ARP spoofing and active fingerprinting through manual TCP connections. Powered by a Random Forest classifier, the machine learning model extracts features from network packets for accurate OS identification. The tool's modular design offers flexibility in selecting passive or active methods. Validated through real-world scenarios, the tool demonstrates precision in identifying OS types and versions, providing actionable insights for network security enhancement. The integration of machine learning ensures adaptability in dynamic network environments, making it a valuable asset for security professionals navigating intricate network landscapes.
